This project was created using Qt Creator 5.8.0 and c++ and has 8 classes. The first class that runs is the Login class.

The Sign_In class is used for creating new user accounts.

The project uses a database. In the connectData method (found in the Login, Sign_In, and findRidePage classes), you need to enter the full path to your database file.
